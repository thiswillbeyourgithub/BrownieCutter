# BrownieCutter
* I just needed a quick script to lower the time cost of creating new FOSS tools. So just run this script, give the project name and class name and you'll get a proper template dir with some boiletplate code done for you.
* Yes BrownieCutter was created by itself.
* Inspired by [CookieCutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/).

# Getting started
* As an uv tool: `uvx BrownieCutter --help`
* From pypi: `uv pip install BrownieCutter` or `pip install BrownieCutter`
* From git: git clone then `pip install .`
* `BrownieCutter --help`
