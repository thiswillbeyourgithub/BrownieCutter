# BrownieCutter
* I just needed a quick script to lower the time cost of creating new FOSS tools. So just run this script, give the project name and class name and you'll get a proper template dir with some boiletplate code done for you.
* Yes BrownieCutter was created by itself.
* Inspired by [CookieCutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/).

# Getting started
* ` python -m pip install -e .`
* `python -m BrownieCutter --help`
